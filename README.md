# NETLinkBench
Netlink Socket Benchmark Tool
This project is orignally from http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/laurent.lefevre/software/netlinkbench/. The code itself was not available so I used webarchive to find a version from around 2012. The code was not compatible with newer linux versions. I fixed the issues that prevented compilation, and uploaded the project here for easier access.
